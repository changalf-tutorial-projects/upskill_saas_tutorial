[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App

Ruby on Rails tutorial app based on the project from Upskill course.  The app
features a fictional community where developers, entrepreneurs, and investors
can collaborate on projects.  Users need to sign up with either a basic or pro
account, with the latter containing more useful features.  

The app is simple and can use improvements such as UI makeover, new features,
and UX redesign.  The next goal is to create a forum where users can conveniently
message each other, instead of having to email each other.  It is undecided 
whether this feature will be limited to only pro users or open to all.
